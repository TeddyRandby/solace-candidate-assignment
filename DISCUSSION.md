## Where I would go from here
- It would be useful to allow the user to filter on multiple search terms, or incorporate some sort of query language like google search does.
- Use a database, and perform as much querying at the database level as possible
- Incorporate a library for managing the data-fetching on the client side - something with cacheing and loading hooks which would be useful for creating a better user experience.
